# Image Enhancer

This skill takes your images and screenshots and makes them look better—sharper, clearer, and more professional.

## When to Use This Skill

- Improving screenshot quality for blog posts or documentation
- Enhancing images before sharing on social media
- Preparing images for presentations or reports
- Upscaling low-resolution images
- Sharpening blurry photos
- Cleaning up compressed images

## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes Image Quality**: Checks resolution, sharpness, and compression artifacts
2. **Enhances Resolution**: Upscales images intelligently
3. **Improves Sharpness**: Enhances edges and details
4. **Reduces Artifacts**: Cleans up compression artifacts and noise
5. **Optimizes for Use Case**: Adjusts based on intended use (web, print, social media)

## Failure Handling

- If the input file does not exist or is not an image, stop and ask for a valid image path.
- If the user requests enhancement of many files, preview the file count and output naming pattern before processing.
- If the image contains small text, prioritize readability and avoid aggressive denoising that smears glyphs.
- If an enhancement tool is unavailable, preserve the original and explain the missing dependency instead of producing a low-quality replacement.

## CHECKPOINTS

- STOP before overwriting any existing file. Default to writing a new file with an `-enhanced` suffix.
- STOP before batch processing more than 10 images unless the user explicitly asked for bulk enhancement.

## Do Not Do

- Do not claim resolution, sharpness, or artifact improvements without creating an output file or explaining that this is only guidance.
- Do not modify originals in place.
- Do not invent nonexistent image-analysis results when no visual or file inspection was performed.

## How to Use

### Basic Enhancement

```
Improve the image quality of screenshot.png
```

```
Enhance all images in this folder
```

### Specific Improvements

```
Upscale this image to 4K resolution
```

```
Sharpen this blurry screenshot
```

```
Reduce compression artifacts in this image
```

### Batch Processing

```
Improve the quality of all PNG files in this directory
```

## Example

**User**: "Improve the image quality of screenshot-2024.png"

**Output**:
```
Analyzing screenshot-2024.png...

Current specs:
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: PNG
- Quality: Good, but slight blur

Enhancements applied:
✓ Upscaled to 2560x1440 (retina)
✓ Sharpened edges
✓ Enhanced text clarity
✓ Optimized file size

Saved as: screenshot-2024-enhanced.png
Original preserved as: screenshot-2024-original.png
```

## Tips

- Always keeps original files as backup
- Works best with screenshots and digital images
- Can batch process entire folders
- Specify output format if needed (PNG for quality, JPG for smaller size)
- For social media, mention the platform for optimal sizing

## Common Use Cases

- **Blog Posts**: Enhance screenshots before publishing
- **Documentation**: Make UI screenshots crystal clear
- **Social Media**: Optimize images for Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram
- **Presentations**: Upscale images for large screens
- **Print Materials**: Increase resolution for physical media
